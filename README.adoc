OBazl coswitch

== Usage

`@coswitch` only converts existing OPAM switches, so to use it you
must install and configure a switch. See below for instructions. You
must rerun coswitch whenever you change your switch (by installing or
removing packages).

Once you have installed a coswitch, you can express dependencies on
OPAM packages by adding `bazel_dep` directives to your root
`MODULE.bazel` file; for example:

    bazel_dep(name = "alcotest",        version = "0.0.0")

IMPORTANT: Version "0.0.0" is a dummy bzlmod version id; the
dependency will resolve to whatever version is installed in OPAM.

WARNING: If you add `bazel_dep` directives before you install the
coswitch, you will run into a bootstrapping problem. Bazel will not be
able to run or build any target because it will not be able resolve
the `bazel_deps`. In particular it will not be able to run the `bazel
run @coswitch//new` command needed to create the coswitch that will
enable `bazel_dep` resolution. To avoid this you can install the
`coswitch` executable on your PATH so you can run it independent of
Bazel. See instructions below.

=== configuration

You can run `@coswitch` from any directory equipped with the following
files: `.bazelrc`, `MODULE.bazel`, and `WORKSPACE.bazel`. If you
install it locally, as described below, you can run it independent of Bazel.

<1> `INFO` messages are printed by Bazel
<2> Printed by `@coswitch//new`  (with `$HOME` expanded)

By default each coswitch is installed in the corresponding switch, in
`$OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX/share/obazl`. To instead install to
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/obazl`, pass ` -- -x` or ` -- --xdg`.

You can ask `@coswitch//new` to print more information by passing `-v` one or more times; such arguments must be passed _after_ `--`; for example:

    $ bazel run @coswitch//new -- -v

To silence messages from `@coswitch//new`, pass `-q` or `--quiet`.

To silence messages from Bazel you can use these directives (documented at link:https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual[Commands and Options] and link:https://bazel.build/reference/command-line-reference[Command-Line Reference]), which may be passed on the command line (NB: _before_ `--`) or added to `.config/user.bazelrc`:

----
--noshow_progress
--noshow_loading_progress
--show_result=0
--ui_event_filters=-<event>,-<event>   <1>
----
<1> where <event> is one of: fatal, error, warning, info, progress, debug, start, finish, subcommand, stdout, stderr, pass, fail, timeout, cancelled or depchecker

=== --registry directives

Once you have configured a coswitch, you must tell Bazel to use it by
passing a `--registry=` directive pointing to the coswitch. For example,

    --registry=file:///home/<uid>/.opam/5.1.0/share/obazl

You can pass this on the command line, but it will be more convenient
to put it in a bazelrc file. One strategy is to put it in
`.config/coswitch_registry.bazelrc`, and then add this to `.bazelrc` (as noted above):

    try-import %workspace%/.config/coswitch_registry.bazelrc
    common --registry=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obazl/registry/main/
    common --registry=https://bcr.bazel.build

IMPORTANT: Order matters. The coswitch `--registry` directive should
be first, and the directive for the BCR must come last.

If you work with multiple OPAM switches, you will need to create a
coswitch for each; then to change to use a different coswitch, edit
your `--registry` directive.

NOTE: Use of coswitches in this manner is independent of the "current"
OPAM switch.

For better integration with OPAM and the shell, you can use a shell
script to wrap the bazel invocation. When you install coswitch, a
sample script is installed at
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/obazl/templates/bazel_wrapper.sh`. Copy this file to
`tools/bazel` (it must be an executable named `bazel`). Now when you
run a bazel command, control will be passed to this script, which runs
`opam switch show` to discover the current switch, and then constructs
the appropriate `--registry` directive and adds it to the bazel
command.


=== installation

----
$ bazel run @coswitch//install
----

This will install the coswitch executable to
`$HOME/.local/bin/coswitch`; it will also install some template files
to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/obazl/templates`.

You can install the executable to a different directory by passing `
-- -b /path/to/bindir`.

Once you have installed `coswitch` on your local system you can remove
its `bazel_dep` from your MODULE.bazel file, and run `$ coswitch`.

== How It Works

`@coswitch` converts `META` files in the OPAM switch to `BUILD.bazel`
files in the Bazel "coswitch".  It also generates _bzlmod_ registry records.

By default, both the coswitch and the registry are created in
`$OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX/share/obazl`.

If you pass `-- --xdg`, they are installed to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/obazl`:

    $XDG_DATA_HOME/obazl/opam/<switch name>
    $XDG_DATA_HOME/obazl/registry/<switch name>

=== Coswitch

A coswitch is essentially a mirror of a switch. Symlinks are used to integrate the the two.

For example, the coswitch record for package `yojson` of switch
`fiveone` (as describe below in <<Creating an OPAM switch>>) looks like this:

=== Registry

For each Bazel module in the coswitch (i.e. package in the switch),
`@coswitch//new` also creates a Bazel registry record. The Bazel registry
has this structure (documented at
link:https://bazel.build/external/registry[Bazel registries]):

----
$ tree -L 1 .opam/510a/share/obazl/
.opam/510a/share/obazl/
├── bazel_registry.json
├── lib                        <1>
└── modules                    <2>
----
<1> Contains coswitch package entries as described above
<2> Contains bzlmod registry records


With ` -- --xdg`:

----
$ tree -L 1 .local/share/obazl/registry/fiveone
.local/share/obazl/registry/fiveone
├── bazel_registry.json
└── modules
----

The `bazel_registry.json` file points to the coswitch:

..opam/fiveone/share/obazl/bazel_registry.json
----
{
    "mirrors": [],               <1>
    "module_base_path": "lib"     <2>
}
----
<1> Not used
<2> Relative to cwd; serves as based dir for relative paths in registry records

..local/share/obazl/registry/fiveone/bazel_registry.json
----
{
    "mirrors": [],                                                       <1>
    "module_base_path": "$HOME/.local/share/obazl/opam/fiveone/lib"     <2>
}
----
<1> Not used
<2> Registry records implicitly reference this base path (in this case, absolute path)

The `modules` subdirectory contains one record per Bazel module. The record for `yojson`:

----
$ tree .local/share/obazl/registry/fiveone/modules/yojson                                                              [fiveone]
.local/share/obazl/registry/fiveone/modules/yojson
├── 0.0.0
│   ├── MODULE.bazel
│   └── source.json
└── metadata.json
----

The `source.json` file contains the information Bazel needs to find
the sources of the `yojson` module. In a networked registry, this
would be a URL and integrity checksum. But this registry is for local
use only, so instead the `source.json` file looks like this:

[source,json]
----
{
    "type": "local_path",       <1>
    "path": "yojson"            <2>
}
----
<1> Tells Bazel to use the `module_base_path` field of the registry's `bazel_registry.json` file to construct the local path to module source.
<2> To be interpreted as the desired subdirectory of `module_base_path`.

Together, `bazel_registry.json` and `yojson/0.0.0/source.json` indicate that the sources for `yojson` are located at `$HOME/.local/share/obazl/opam/fiveone/lib/yojson`.

=== Build target labels

Once `@coswitch//new` has done its work, the packages in the switch
are available to Bazel build programs as standard Bazel labels. The
labels are constructed according to a simple schema: package `p`
becomes `@p//lib/p`; package `p.q.r` becomes `@p//lib/q/r`.
Executables are labelled `@p//bin/p`; they are also accesible as
`@ocaml//bin:p`.

Some examples:

[cols="1,1",width="50%"]
|===
| OPAM | Bazel

| `ounit2` | `@ounit2//lib/ounit2`
| `mtime` | `@mtime//lib/mtime`
| `mtime.clock.os` | `@mtime//lib/clock/os`
| `yojson` | `@yojson//lib/yojson`
|===

=== The `@ocaml` module

Most (all?) OPAM packages contain one `META` file in their root
directories. The standard compiler distributions are a little
different. They contain a small number of "distrib-packages":

* compiler-libs
* dynlink
* ocamldoc
* runtime_events (>=5.0.0)
* stdlib
* str
* threads
* unix

These are packages (so they can be listed as dependencies), but they
are included in the compiler distributions rather than as
free-standing OPAM/findlib packages.

Special case: `num`. Implemented as a free-standing pkg, but installs
its files to the standard lib dir (lib/ocaml).

Prior to version `5.0.0` the distributions contained no `META` files
for these packages within the `ocaml` package. Instead, the
distrib-packages were expressed as OPAM top-level "virtual" packages
with redirection to artifacts in `lib/ocaml`. They would be installed by OPAM when the compiler was installed.

For example, the `dynlink` package for `4.14.0` is represented by
`<opam-root>/4.14.0/lib/dynlink`, which contains only a `META` file
indicating that the `dynlink` archive files are found in
`<opam-root>/4.14.0/ocaml`

Starting with `5.0.0` the distib-packages are expressed by eight
nested `META` files:

----
lib/ocaml/compiler-libs/META
lib/ocaml/dynlink/META
lib/ocaml/ocamldoc/META
lib/ocaml/runtime_events/META
lib/ocaml/stdlib/META
lib/ocaml/str/META
lib/ocaml/threads/META
lib/ocaml/unix/META
----

These packages are no longer represented by toplevel subdirectories
within the switch' `lib` subdirectory.

`@coswitch//new` creates a Bazel package for each of these as
subpackages of the `@ocaml` module. For example,
`@ocaml//lib/dynlink`. For compatibility it also creates a Bazel
module for each; for example, `@dynlink//lib/dynlink`.  The build targets in these packages are aliased to those in the `@ocaml` module:

    @dynlink//lib/dynlink => @ocaml//lib/dynlink

`@coswitch//new` has special logic for translating the compiler
distribution itself.

[cols="2,3"]
|===
| Bazel pkg | Imports (by symlinks to <switch-prefix>)
| `@ocaml//bin` |  `bin`
| `@ocaml//lib/compiler-libs` | `lib/ocaml/compiler-libs`

=== Registry selection

See section above on `--registry` directives.


== Creating an OPAM switch

First update your OPAM installation: `$ opam update`

Then create a switch, giving it a name and a compiler version. Synax: [nobreak]`opam switch create <name> <compiler id>` or just [nobreak]`opam switch
create <compiler id>`.

To list available compilers: `$ opam switch list-available`

    $ opam switch create fiveone 5.1.0

This should install the switch and make it the "current" switch. Verify:

    $ opam switch

Now install the packages you need:

    opam install base bigarray-compat cppo csexp

If you need a lot of packages you can create a simple script:

[source,shell,title="opaminst.sh"]
----
#!/bin/sh
opam install a b c ... etc. ...
----

Verify installation:

    $ opam list
